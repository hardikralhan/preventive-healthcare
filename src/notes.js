    title: "Abdominal Pain",
    introduction:
      "Abdominal pain can be felt anywhere between thorax ( chest ) and pelvis. Pain could be mild, moderate or severe. It may be dull or acute. Almost everyone has experienced abdominal pain, one time or other.  Most of the time, stomach pain is not serious, but severe abdominal pain is a cause of concern.  If pain starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as an emergency, and investigated accordingly.",

    title: "Asthma",
    introduction:
      "Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes (airways) swells, causing the airways to narrow, turn more sensitive to irritants in the environment, and thus reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs. The causes of asthma are not completely understood.",

    ],
    management: [
      "Medications: Medicines in asthma is generally given through the inhaled route. “Metered dose” and “dry powder” inhalers are equally effective for long term use, the “nebulized” form being generally used during acute attacks. Inhaling a drug is an effective way of taking an asthma medicine as it goes straight to the lungs, with very little ending up elsewhere in the body. There are two types of inhaled medications. Since asthma is an inflammatory disease, preventer medication should not be discontinued without medical advice.",
      "Airway-opening medication or Quick-Relief” (Reliever) inhaler: The inhaler usually contains a short-acting beta 2-agonist. It works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol, levo-salbutamol and terbutaline. They are utilized in stopping asthma attacks.",
      "Short courses of corticosteroid and other drugs (oral or injectable) may be required during acute attacks and are to be used after medical advice only.",
      "An asthma patient should learn from the care-provider the correct method of using the inhalation devices (metered-dose inhalers, dry-powder inhalers, spacers, etc) used for the medication and always carry the quick-reliever medication with him/her."

    title: "Dengue Fever",
    introduction:
      "Dengue is a viral disease, transmitted by the infective bite of a particular mosquito known as Aedes Aegypti. Human being develops disease after 5 – 6 days of being bitten by an infective mosquito. It occurs in two forms: Classical Dengue fever also known as “break bone” fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which is life threatening. It is very common after rainy season. It is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another through mosquito bites. It is widespread in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It is a very common disease in India since last two decades. Dengue can affect everybody, irrespective of their age and gender. However, deaths are common amongst children during DHF outbreak.The disease is endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The America, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected.In the year 2015, According to National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) maximum numbers of cases were reported from Delhi followed by Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Gujarat , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Telangana and other states.",

    causes: [
      "Dengue virus is an RNA virus. Transmission of this virus occurs in a cycle. An infected human is bitten by a female mosquito. The infected mosquito then bites another human, and the cycle continues.",
      "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes most commonly bite at dusk and dawn, indoors, in shady areas, or when the weather is cloudy. They can bite and spread infection at any time of day and all year long.",
      "The mosquitoes prefer to breed in areas of stagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, water coolers and discarded tires.",
      "Some of the dangerous areas are wet floors and toilet tanks, as they allow the mosquitoes to breed in the residence."

    diagnosis: [
      "Microscopic examination: This is done in order to detect dengue. The earliest change detectable is a low white blood cell count which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis.",
      "Haematocrit -Haemoconcentration, as estimated by an increase in haematocrit of 20% or more compared with convalescent values, is suggestive of hypovolaemia due to vascular permeability and plasma leakage.",
      "Virus isolation - Cell culture is the most widely used method for dengue virus isolation",
      "Nucleic acid detection- Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays offer better sensitivity compared to virus isolation. Dengue virus (Nucleic acid) can be detected in the blood about first 5 days after onset of symptoms.Nucleic acid detection- Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays offer better sensitivity compared to virus isolation.

    title: "Food Poisoning",
    introduction:
      "Food poisoning is illness that results due to the consumption of food or drink which is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Most people recover without the need for treatment. In most cases, the food that causes the illness has been contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or   Escherichia coli, or a virus, such as the norovirus. The contamination of food can occur at any point beginning from growing, till processing and shipping of the product. Improper cooking of the food may also be the cause for contamination other cause can be when pathogens are transferred from one surface to another especially in case of ready-to-eat foods or raw foods. Since these foods aren’t cooked before consumption, pathogens are not destroyed and ingesting them may lead to food poisoning. This is called cross-contamination. Thus the contamination of food may occur at any stage in the process from food production to consumption.",
    symptoms: ["Feeling unwell", "Vomiting", "Diarrhoea", "Stomach cramps"],
    causes: [
      "Food borne illness are usually infectious or toxic in nature and caused by bacteria ,viruses, parasites or chemical substances entering the body  through contaminated food or water arise from improper handling, preparation or storage of food.",
      "Cross-contamination: Cross-contamination is a cause of food poisoning that is often over  looked. It occurs when harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment."
    ],
    diagnosis: [
      "Generally detailed history including signs, symptoms and details of food intake are used to diagnose for the food poisoning.Symptoms may include pain in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and signs and symptoms of dehydration (body does not have as much water and fluids as it should)"

    title: "Jaundice",
    introduction:
      "Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the body can cause jaundice. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver. There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can occur: If red blood cells broke down too early, the spleen gets overloaded and hence too much bilirubin is produced to be handled by the liver. Unprocessed bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream and eventually the skin and eyes looks yellow. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. At times this condition is inherited. Hemolytic anemia may also occur as a side-effect of certain drugs. Sometimes the trouble is in the liver cells. If there is a faulty uptake, processing or excretion of bilirubin it will result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Newborn babies can be temporarily jaundiced because of lack of mature enzymes needed to process bilirubin. In adults, alcoholism is a common cause of damage to liver cells. Other toxins and certain drugs can also cause acute damage to the liver. A blockage in the bile duct can also result in a build-up of fully processed bilirubin. This can spill over into the urine and cause it to become very dark. The blockage is most commonly caused by a gallstone.",
    symptoms: [
      "Yellow discoloration of the eyes and of the skin",
      "Pale coloured stools (faeces)",
      "Dark coloured urine"
    ],
    causes: [
      "Pre-hepatic jaundice: Pre hepatic jaundice is due to increased rate of haemolysis (breakdown of RBCs). Causes of haemolysis include:",
      "Malaria",
      "Sickle cell anemia",
      "Thalassaemia",
      "Gilbert syndrome",
      "Hepatocellular jaundice:  Hepato cellular jaundice can be due to any infection in the liver. It can be due to infection or exposure to a harmful substance, such as alcohol, disrupts the liver’s ability to process bilirubin.",
      "Post hepatic jaundice: Post-hepatic jaundice, is also called as obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of bile in the biliary system. The most common cause is due to gallstone in the common bile duct or due to pancreatic cancer."
    ],
    diagnosis: [
      "Urine test: It is used to measure levels of a substance called urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is produced when bacteria break down bilirubin inside the digestive system.",
      "Blood tests: Blood tests include blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (which causes the jaundice), and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin.",
      "Other primary lab tests for liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and prothrombin time (PT).",
      "NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose consult physician. "
    ],
    management: [
      "In treating pre-hepatic jaundice, the objective is to prevent the rapid breakdown of red blood cells that's causing the level of bilirubin to build up in the blood. In cases of infections, such as malaria, the use of medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells. Gilbert's syndrome doesn't usually require treatment because the jaundice associated with the condition isn't particularly serious and doesn't pose a serious threat to health.",
      "In cases of intra-hepatic jaundice, there's little that can be done to repair any liver damage, although the liver can often repair itself over time. Therefore, the aim of treatment is to prevent any further liver damage occurring. For liver damage that's caused by infection, such as viral hepatitis or glandular fever, anti-viral medications may be used to help prevent further damage."
